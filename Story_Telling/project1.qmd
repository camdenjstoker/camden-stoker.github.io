## Project Notes

__For Project 1 the answer to each question should include a chart **and** a written response. The years labels on your charts should not include a comma. At least **two** of your charts must include reference marks.__  

```{python}
# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv")
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.capitalize()
```

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
# Clean up column names

# Filter for Camden and add a 'Label' column for the color legend
camden = df[df['Name'] == 'Camden'].copy()
camden['Label'] = 'Camden'  

# Create vertical line reference with a label for legend
vline_df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [2003], 'Label': ['Birth Year (2003)']})

# Plot with legend for both lines
ggplot() + \
    geom_line(data=camden, mapping=aes(x='Year', y='Total', color='Label')) + \
    geom_vline(data=vline_df, mapping=aes(xintercept='x', color='Label'), linetype='dashed') + \
    ggtitle('Usage of the Name Camden Over Time') + \
    xlab('Year') + \
    ylab('Count') + \
    scale_color_manual(values={'The Name "Camden"': 'blue', 'Birth Year (2003)': 'red'}) 
```
**Discussion:**
The name Camden began to rise significantly in popularity during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2003, the year I was born, it was gaining momentum and continued to rise until around 2014, when it peaked. Before the 1990s, the name was used very rarely. Although its popularity has slightly declined since its peak, it remains a relatively modern and well-used name.


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

#Filter for the name Brittany
brittany = df[df['Name'] == 'Brittany'].copy()

brittany['Label'] = 'Brittany'

ggplot(brittany, aes(x='Year', y='Total', color='Label')) + \
    geom_line() + \
    ggtitle('Popularity of the Name Brittany Over Time') + \
    xlab('Year') + \
    ylab('Number of Babies Named Brittany') + \
    scale_color_manual(values={'Brittany': 'red'})
```
**Discussion:**
The name Brittany saw a dramatic rise in popularity in the 1980s and peaked around 1990. Based on this trend, if I talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, I would guess she is around 34–36 years old. I would not guess she is under 25 or over 50, as the name became much less common outside of the 1985–1995 window.


## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names in a single chart. What trends do you notice?__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

# Filter for the selected names and years
filtered_names = df[
  (df['Name'].isin(['Mary', 'Martha', 'Peter', 'Paul'])) &
  (df['Year'].between(1920, 2000))
].copy()

# Label column legend
filtered_names['Label'] = filtered_names['Name']

# Plot
ggplot(filtered_names) + \
    geom_line(aes(x= 'Year', y= 'Total', color= 'Label')) + \
    ggtitle('Name Usage Over Time (1920-2000)') + \
    xlab('Year') + \
    ylab('Total Births')
```
**Discussion:**
The overall trend that can be seen is that these christian names peaked in popularity between the years 1948-1954. We see that after the year 1950 when the name Mary peaked that it had a very steep decrease from its popularity. 


## QUESTION|TASK 4

__Think of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?__  

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

# filter for the name ELsa
elsa = df[df['Name'] == 'Elsa'].copy()

# Reference Line for Frozen
vline_df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [2013], 'label': ['Frozen Release (2013)']})

# Label column
elsa['Label'] = 'The Name Elsa'

# plot
ggplot() +\
    geom_line(data=elsa, mapping=aes(x= 'Year', y='Total', color='Label')) +\
    geom_vline(data=vline_df, mapping=aes(xintercept='x', color='label'),linetype='dashed') + \
    ggtitle('Usage of the Name Elsa Over Time') + \
    xlab('Year') + \
    ylab('Count') + \
    scale_color_manual(values={'The Name Elsa': 'blue', 'Frozen Release (2013)': 'red'})

```
**Discussion:**
We can see that the name Elsa has not been particularly popular except for slight growth in popularity leading up to the point when the movie was released. Then the year after we see that the name had an all time high and spike. Then it started to decline right after.
